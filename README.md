## 🏆 Origin & Hackathon Story

LexTrack-AI was originally built during **Epochon Hackathon** — a 24-hour team sprint — and **won First Prize (Gold)** for its production-grade architecture and real-world applicability.

The project was conceived, architected, and led by **Nithish Kumar S** (team lead), and built collaboratively with the team under a shared team repository during the hackathon.

Following the win, the project was officially **handed over to Nithish Kumar S** as team leader for continued development, scalability improvements, and long-term maintenance. This repository is the independently maintained version of that original build — extended with cleaner code organization, improved modularity, and a focus on production readiness.

> *What started as a 24-hour sprint is now being engineered into a real product.*

## 🧠 What is LexTrack-AI?

LexTrack-AI is a **7-agent legal AI system** built with a human-in-the-loop philosophy. Instead of blindly automating legal decisions, it combines AI intelligence with built-in self-awareness — explicitly refusing to act when it isn't confident enough.

The core design principle: **safety over speed**.

## 🤖 The 7 Agents

### 1. 🔍 Smart Research Agent
Searches IPC, BNS, and case laws to find the exact legal sections required for a given situation.

**Edge over standard search:**
- Cross-references repealed laws with current statutes
- Warns if a cited case law has been overruled or weakened
- Prevents reliance on outdated or invalid legal provisions

---

### 2. 📄 Document Analysis Agent
Analyzes long legal documents and contracts to detect hidden, unfair, or risky clauses.

**Edge over standard review:**
- Assigns a **risk score** to every clause
- Flags potentially illegal or one-sided terms
- Summarizes complex clauses into plain English

---

### 3. 🗺️ Procedure Guidance Agent
Provides a step-by-step roadmap for filing cases, including deadlines and required forms.

**Edge over generic guidance:**
- Verifies jurisdiction based on user location
- Prevents missed deadlines
- Ensures filings are made in the correct court

---

### 4. 📊 Compliance Monitoring Agent
Continuously tracks regulatory changes relevant to businesses and individuals.

**Edge over manual tracking:**
- Alerts users about new or updated compliance rules
- Predicts potential financial penalties for non-compliance
- Maintains a log of compliant actions for audits

---

### 5. ✍️ Smart Scribe (Petition Generator)
Converts user-provided facts into a court-ready legal petition.

**Edge over template-based drafting:**
- Refuses to draft documents if facts are contradictory
- Detects missing evidence before submission
- Reduces chances of petition rejection

---

### 6. 🧠 Self-Doubt Engine *(Core Safety Logic)*
Calculates a **confidence score (0–100)** based on data completeness and risk level. This is the backbone of the system's safety model.

**Why this matters:**
- Explicitly declines decisions when confidence is low
- Escalates high-risk cases to human professionals
- Prevents blind automation in sensitive legal matters

> *Every agent decision passes through the Self-Doubt Engine before execution.*

---

### 7. 📅 Smart Hearing Scheduler
Tracks court hearing dates and notifies all relevant parties.

**Edge over manual scheduling:**
- Sends automated reminders to lawyers and clients
- Triggers a critical document review 48 hours before hearings
- Identifies missing filings or evidence in advance
